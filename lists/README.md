# Lists

- **List** is a collection of items in a particular order.
- Good idea to make the name of a list _plural_.
- Square brackets ([]) indicate list. Individual items in a list are separated by a comma.

# Accessing Elements in a List

- Lists are ordered collections, and to access an element in a list, you tell Python the position, or _index_ of the desired element.
- To access an element, you write the name of the list followed by its index enclosed in square brackets.
  > Index positions start at 0, not 1.
- To access the last item in a list, use -1. This tells Python to always return last element in a list.
  > You can use individual values from a list the same way you can with others. You can concatenate with other parts of a string.

# Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements

- Mostly, we will handle dynamic lists.
- For instance, in gaming, most aspects will keep on increasing and decreasing to make it more interesting for the players.

# Modifying Elements

- Its syntax is similar to the one of accessing elements in a list. You provide the name of a list followed by index and finally the new value you want to insert.

# Adding Items to List

## Appending Elements to the End of The List
