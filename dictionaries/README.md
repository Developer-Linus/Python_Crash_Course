# Dictionary

- In Python, dictionary is a collection of `key-value` pairs.
- Defined using braces `{}`.
- Every key in dictionary has its associated value, and you can access the value associated with that key.
- The key's value can take a string, integer, list, dictionary, or any Python data type.

## Accessing values in a dictionary

- Give the name of dictionary and inside the square brackets, provide the name of the key. Python will return the value associated with that key.

## Adding New Key-Value Pairs

- Dictionaries are dynamic data structures and you can add key-value pairs at any time.
- To add a new key-value pair, provide the name of the dictionary and new key in square brackets along with the intended value.
- Python doesn't care about the order you used to add key-value pairs to the dictionary. It only cares about their connection between each key and its value.

## Starting with an Empty Dictionary

- At times, it is convenient or necessary to start with an empty dictionary and add key-value pairs at a later time.
- First, you define an empty dictionary with just braces.
- You can then add the key-value pairs.
- Commonly used in user-supplied data scenarios or when automatically generating key-value pairs.

## Modifying Values in a Dictionary

- To modify a dictionary's value, you give the name of the dictionary and provide the key in square brackets then give its new associated value.
