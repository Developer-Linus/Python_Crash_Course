# CLASSES
- OOP is one of the effective approaches for writing software.
- In OOP, you write `classes` that represent real-world things and situations, and you create `objects` based on these classes.
- When you write a class, you define the behaviour that a whole category will have. 
- Making an object from a class is called `instantiation`, and you work with `instances` from a class. 
- Knowing how to write classes helps improve logical thinking that is useful in solving any challenge I might encounter. 
## Creating and Using a Class
- You can model anything using classes.
- To create a class, you need to provide information (data) and behaviours (methods) of that class. For example, we can model the class dog for any dog. Let's say, for example, every dog has got a name and age. Also, every dog can sit or rollover. Information is name and age, while sit and roll over are behaviours.
